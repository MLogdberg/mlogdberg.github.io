MSI or Managed Service Identity that it stands for has been around for some time but quite recently a new set of resources has been integrated in to this and we need to start thinking of using MSI alot more. Since this will increase security and streamline the authorization process, one place to grant access, same account and authorization process. Sadly most of Microsoft's documentation around this is still for Virtual Machines and I want to enlighten this alot more for IPaaS services like Logic Apps, Functions, API Management, Web Apps, DataFactory Service Bus and Event Grid.

So MSI is an identity of a resource just like any other user in Azure AD. The beuty of this is that with this we can assign access rights to that identity and the resource now authenticates by itself (with credentials no one else nows) and with those credentials it can use the resource.
I usually like to discribe at as a virtualization of the service and used for authorization purposes, in the image bellow we can see that an Azure Function are doing requests to a Cosmos. This is allowed since we have assigned the role **Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor** to the identity of the function in a scope containing the Cosmos resource (could be on resource itself, a resource group that grants access to all cosmos resources in the resource group, or subscription granting access to all cosmos resources in that subscription).

What Resources can use MSI: (there are more but these are Integration focused)
* Logic Apps, 
* Azure Functions
* API Management 
* Web Apps 
* DataFactory 
* Event Grid
Read the full list [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities).


What resources can we use authenticate to with MSI.
* Azure SQL
* Cosmos
* Service Bus
* Event Hub
* Azure Functions (if you use Azure AD as provider in *Authentication*)
* Web Site (if you use Azure AD as provider in *Authentication*)
* Logic Apps (If you use Oauth Authorization)
  * In Logic Apps we can use MSI to connect to resources like Event Grid for creating subscriptions.


### Is this not what we accomplished before?
No before we created a SQL account, took keys from Cosmos, Service Bus etc, create a service principal or a service user in AD to accomplish other acesses. All of these could potentiaally be simplified and changed to only give the resource the appropiate access rights. Note not all resources is supporting this yet, but this is an area where Microsoft has done some great gains last 6 months.

### But isn't this making my development process a pain?
No on the contrary, you as a developer don't need to gather all these credentials either, development and testing can be used with your own account. Making it easier to get started and another great benefit is that you cannot accidently keep credentials and access after an completed assignement or project. With good documentation it's also easier to get a new teammate up to speed. Another good thing is that we know that credentials are not wandering away when members leave the team.

### What sould I think off
You might end up in a situation where you usually could grant access yourself to different resources, since this the resource itself that granted the access you as a developer often had the full access to do so. But as soon as we start using MSI the access is granted by Azure AD and this is often locked down to developers. Since Authroization now need's to be given by a user with **Owner** or **User Access Administrator", to come around this you need to create a plan for your team how this should be done.


A tip here is to create a Azure AD Group and add all developers to it that need specific access, remove them when they don't need it. An extra step would be creating a PIM group for it.
